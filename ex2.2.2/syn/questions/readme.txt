--- Question 5
    Analyze the report: which are the differences among the paths?

From the timing report we got 4 critical path with starting point 
A[1] and Y[63], Y[62], Y[61], Y[60] as end points. Comparing these
paths what can be noticed is that signal pass through the same
components, thus the same delay time occur. In particular 
comparing the paths A[1] -> Y[63] and A[1] -> Y[62] the critial
path involves the signal propagation through the shifter by a 
power of 2 component first, then the complementor.
Later it pass through the P4 adder, before reaching the multiplexer.
Overll the path is the same since the components are the same, and
are just generated multiple time. 
The only difference is in the real end step of the path since
Y[63] is the MSB generated by the sum generator of the adder while
Y[62] is the MSB-1. Despite that, the delay is always the same.
==================================================================
--- Question 6
    Look at the differences: did something change? Display the 
    critical path and compare it with the previous results.
    If there is any improvement, explain why.

At a high abstract level, it can be noticed that components have 
been enhanced from a timing perspective. In particular, when 
comparing the two critical paths, the optimized and non-optimized 
paths exhibit different timings, resulting in a delay reduction. 
For example, the shifter experiences a delay reduction from 
0.61 ns to 0.27 ns, while the comparator's delay decreases from 
2.33 ns to 1.99 ns. 
For more detailed information regarding the enhancement of gates, 
refer to the response to question 2 concerning the P4 adder.

Lastly, the timing report indicates that constraints are violated 
since the required data time is 8.22 ns, whereas the actual arrival 
time is 8.53 ns. Therefore, the slack is negative, and the 
constraints are violated.
==================================================================
--- Question 7
    Which are the differences with respect to the results 
    obtained before?

Overall the timing and area results are the same, but at
the end the post synthesis vhdl and verilog file is generated.
==================================================================
--- Question 8
    How was the synthesized managed to obtain a lower delay? 
    Browse the design and see what has changed. Look at the saved
    VHDL netlist as well and see the used components.

Upon reviewing the signal propagation table provided by the 
report_timing command, we observed that in the optimized version, 
certain blocks have been implemented differently. For instance, 
examining the implementation of the block (named pg_block_931), 
the signal propagation path passes through an AND-OR-inverter and 
then through an inverter, whereas in the optimized version, it 
passes through an AND gate only. This modification ultimately 
leads to a reduction in delay, as evidenced by the delay column
(the second one). Specifically, we transition 
from 0.04 ns + 0.02 ns to 0.05 ns.

* These data have been obtained from the MUL_timeopt_1t.rpt and 
  MUL_timeopt_2t.rpt files.
